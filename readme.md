### Brett Searle Blog post

This blog was built with the goal to show the consumer that they can get any make or model of a very rare vehicle. Anyone can look through and compare the small but important differences of the different generations of the Subaru WRX STI

I realize that the image quality of this "90s wrx sti "photo is sub par but this generation is very very rare and hard to find a photo of in general let alone a 2000px wide one. This is the best I could find.
